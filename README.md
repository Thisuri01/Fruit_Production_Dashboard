# Interactive Dashboard on Food Production in Sri Lanka

## Data

All data were sourced from the Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka (https:/www.statistics.gov.lk/HIES/HIES2006_07Website/).

District-level maps were generated using the ceylon package in R (https://github.com/thiyangt/ceylon). The dashboard was developed in R Markdown to ensure full reproducibility of the outputs.

## Data description

Production - Fruit production (000 Nuts)

Extent - Area of cultivation in hectare

## Remarks

Productivity = (Production / Extent) * 1000

Measuresd in nuts per hectare

## Policy Implications and Recommendations 

Some districts, like Kilinochchi in 2015, have shown outstanding results in fruit production, 
and their methods could inspire other regions. The drop in production after 2020 was due to 
COVID-19 disruptions (2020–2021), abrupt agro-input ban (2021), and economic crisis 
(2022). While mangoes dominate production, growing a wider variety of fruits could help 
farmers cope better with market changes and unpredictable weather. Since having more land 
doesn’t always provide better harvests, the focus should be given to better farming techniques 
and ways to handle crops after harvest, which could help lift productivity for all fruits.
